## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nico and turn my passion for programming into a career. If you're interested, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-clack/) or drop me an email at [nico@bn7.net](mailto:nico@bn7.net).

I've been trying to round out my experience since I finished college and most recently this has meant joining the [TechNative Digital](https://www.technativedigital.com/) bootcamp, which I'll finish in July.

## Projects

My profile itself only has my more impressive projects. However if you're curious, my more experimental projects can be found in [Experiments](https://github.com/NicoClack-Experiments), my older projects which show my journey in [Archive](https://github.com/NicoClack-Archive) and my really early stuff in [Early Archive](https://github.com/NicoClack-Early-Archive).

Additionally, the 2 group projects I've been part of during the bootcamp, [Milliways](https://github.com/technative-academy/milliways_restaurant) (1st) and [PetSynth](https://github.com/technative-academy/PetSynth) (2nd), are in the [TechNative Organisation](https://github.com/technative-academy).

If you want to browse, I suggest starting with my pinned repositories in order.
